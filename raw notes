* add the concept of up, down, left, right as 2 dimensional points, so that comparing them to each other can be combined into adding vectors - start with #move?
* write a test for "is a valid maze"
* add an overlay and start button. The start button removes the overlay, starts a timer, and shows the cursor. Stop the timer when the maze is completed, and disallow more movements
